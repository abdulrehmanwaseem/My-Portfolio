**Website:** [https://www.fitreps.com](https://www.fitreps.com/)

**Project Overview:**

Fitreps, a fitness platform, wanted to improve the user experience of its subscription system. The original interface was outdated and lacked clarity, especially for differentiating between **recurring subscription plans** and **one-time Fit Credits**. I was hired as a **UI/UX Developer** to redesign and implement a modern, intuitive subscription flow for both desktop and mobile.

---

**My Role**

- Designed and implemented **new subscription modals** for desktop and **swipeable drawers** for mobile.
- Rebuilt the UI with **custom CSS** on top of the client’s **legacy Material UI setup**, without Tailwind CSS.
- Developed a **dark mode version** from scratch since the provided Figma design only included light mode.
- Ensured consistency in theming, typography, and interaction patterns across the app.

---

**Key Challenges & Solutions**

- **Legacy Codebase:** Worked within Material UI with custom themes and no utility-first framework. Solution: wrote modular, scalable custom CSS while respecting existing theme variables.
- **Dark Mode Gap:** The Figma design only provided light mode. I extended the theme system and crafted a clean, consistent dark mode UI from scratch.
- **Complex Subscription Logic:** Implemented clear separation between **Subscription Plans** (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.) and **One-Time Credits**, making flows intuitive for both desktop (modal interactions) and mobile (swipeable drawer).
- **Responsive Consistency:** Adapted layouts to look seamless on different devices while keeping accessibility and usability in mind.

---

![image.png](attachment:64ef98ff-d825-4760-8bab-9cc55ac3c89b:image.png)

**Website:** Internal Project – Can’t Share

**Project Overview**

Precision is an internal real estate due diligence automation platform used by property builders and brokers to upload lease and property data, automatically generate financial models, and view actionable insights. I was brought on board as a **Full Stack Developer (MERN)** to revamp the **CSV/Excel data handling module**, which was too basic to process the complex file structures typically used in the industry.

My task was to build a robust, scalable system that could **ingest and parse complex datasets**, handle errors gracefully, and display structured information in the frontend with precision and clarity.

---

**My Role**

- Enhanced and rebuilt the **CSV/Excel parsing and validation system** to support complex real estate datasets.
- Implemented **robust error handling** and introduced additional data fields for more accurate financial modeling.
- Optimized backend data processing for better performance and reliability.
- Developed clean and structured **frontend data visualizations** to display lease and property information effectively.
- Collaborated with the existing development team to integrate the new module seamlessly into the existing MERN stack application.

---

**Key Challenges & Solutions**

- **Inconsistent & Complex CSV Formats:** The original system failed with real-world datasets.
  _Solution:_ Implemented a flexible parsing mechanism with dynamic schema mapping and comprehensive validation.
- **Error Handling Gaps:** Uploads would silently fail or produce incorrect outputs.
  _Solution:_ Added clear error reporting, logging, and user feedback to prevent silent failures.
- **Data Visualization:** The previous frontend lacked structured presentation.
  _Solution:_ Designed and integrated intuitive tables and views to display processed data accurately, improving usability for brokers and analysts.

---

**Impact**

- Enabled the platform to **handle complex industry-grade CSV/Excel files** reliably.
- Significantly reduced upload errors and improved data accuracy.

## Lead Smart – Affiliate Marketing Dashboard

![image.png](attachment:00b37b34-c858-4868-b412-9c0fd1c8cfa9:image.png)

**Website:** Internal Project (Can’t Share)

**Project Overview**

Lead Smart is a React TypeScript web application designed to manage an affiliate marketing business. It provides an admin dashboard to handle affiliates, monitor their earnings, manage payments, onboard new affiliates, and integrate with external platforms like **Ringba** and **LS Dashboard**.

I was hired to **integrate backend APIs into the frontend**, **redesign the UI/UX for key modules**, and **optimize the codebase structure** to make the app more maintainable and user-friendly.

**My Role**

- Integrated multiple API endpoints (dashboard, affiliates, payments, earnings, email templates) into the React TypeScript frontend.
- Rebuilt the **dashboard UI**, connecting real-time metrics with API data.
- Cleaned up unnecessary files, components, and redundant code to streamline the project structure.
- Updated and refined the UI/UX across modules to make data flows clearer and interactions smoother.
- Ensured proper state management and error handling with Axios and JWT authentication flows.

**Key Challenges & Solutions**

- **Complex API Structure:** The backend exposed multiple affiliate-related endpoints with nested objects. I mapped and normalized these efficiently in the frontend for charts, tables, and forms.
- **Legacy & Redundant Code:** The project had unused components and inconsistent styling. I systematically removed unnecessary files and unified styles using Tailwind + SCSS.
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Dashboard and earnings data came from different platforms (Ringba, LS Dashboard). I built clean data-fetching layers to handle and merge this data seamlessly.
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Certain flows were unclear (especially affiliate CRUD and payment modules). I standardized UI patterns using Radix UI components, modals, and responsive layouts.

**Impact**

- Delivered a fully functional, data-driven **Affiliate Dashboard** with real-time stats and smooth UI interactions.
- Improved developer experience by simplifying the project structure and removing unnecessary bloat.
- Enhanced usability for admins through better data visualization, consistent design, and responsive layouts.

## EdTech Application — Multi-step authentication

![image.png](attachment:84aef864-efb7-49dd-ad0e-6f3f6bec98d3:image.png)

![image.png](attachment:34016d62-a4f0-41b3-9c96-d58a36ed01fd:image.png)

**Website:** Internal Project (Can’t Share)

**Project Overview**

This EdTech platform is designed to connect students, parents, and teachers in an interactive learning ecosystem. It supports multi-step registration, lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and dashboard experiences for different user roles (parents, students, teachers).

I was hired as a Frontend Developer to implement a complex multi-step authentication and registration flow using AWS Cognito and multiple API endpoints. The previous implementation suffered from messy code and excessive props drilling, which made state handling difficult. I resolved this by refactoring the flow using Redux Toolkit for structured and scalable state management.

**My Role**

- Set up authentication flows using AWS Cognito, including parent, child, and hobby registrations.
- Integrated multiple API calls to handle step-wise registration and data persistence.
- Replaced messy prop drilling with Redux Toolkit, creating multiple slices and actions to manage parent and child data cleanly.
- Ensured smooth data flow across multiple registration steps (Parent → Child 1/2/3 → Hobbies).
- Improved form handling and validation using React Hook Form and reusable components.
- Structured the frontend architecture to make it more maintainable and developer-friendly.

**Key Challenges & Solutions**

- **Multi-Step Data Handling:** Registration involved parent plus multiple children with hobbies. I centralized state with Redux, eliminating prop drilling and ensuring data persisted across steps.
- **Cognito Integration Complexity:** AWS Cognito required careful handling of authentication and registration flows. I modularized the API services and managed async actions via Redux for better control.
- **Legacy Code Structure:** The previous implementation was inconsistent. I refactored the structure into clear slices, services, and page components, improving readability and flow.

**Impact**

- Delivered a fully functional, multi-step registration system integrated with AWS Cognito and custom backend APIs.
- Greatly improved state management, making the codebase more modular, scalable, and easier to extend.
- Enhanced user experience during registration by making transitions between steps seamless and reducing API errors.
- Streamlined developer workflow through cleaner architecture and reusable components.
