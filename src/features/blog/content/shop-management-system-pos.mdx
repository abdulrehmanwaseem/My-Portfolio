Managing a small retail business involves juggling invoices, inventory, customers, and financial records — all while trying to serve customers efficiently. I built a **Shop Management System** to solve these exact challenges, creating a full-featured POS that streamlines daily operations.

## The Challenge

Traditional shop management involves:

- Manual invoice creation and tracking
- Spreadsheet-based inventory management
- Disconnected customer and vendor records
- No real-time financial visibility
- Difficulty tracking payment statuses

Small businesses deserve better tools without enterprise-level costs.

## The Solution

**Shop Management System** is a comprehensive POS built with the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) that handles everything from invoicing to inventory tracking.

### Core Features

- Total inventory count and stock status
- Daily, weekly, and monthly sales/revenue
- Purchase and expense tracking
- Visual performance indicators

**🧾 Complete Invoice Management**

Create, download, and print invoices for:

- Sales transactions
- Purchase orders
- Business expenses
- Track payment status: Paid, Partial, Unpaid

**📦 Smart Inventory Tracking**

- Real-time stock level monitoring
- Automated low-stock alerts
- Product details and categorization

**💰 Financial Transaction Logging**
