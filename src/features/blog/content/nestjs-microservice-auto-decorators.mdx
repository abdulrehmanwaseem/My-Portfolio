Building microservices with NestJS often involves writing repetitive message patterns and client communication code. After experiencing this pain point myself, I created **nestjs-microservice-auto-decorators** — a package that eliminates boilerplate and makes microservice communication cleaner and more maintainable.

## The Problem

In traditional NestJS microservices, you need to manually define message patterns in both controllers and services:

```tsx
// Controller
@MessagePattern('users.findAll')
findAll() {
  // handler logic
}

// Service
this.client.send('users.findAll', {})
```

This leads to:

- Duplicated pattern strings across your codebase
- Easy typos and inconsistencies
- Maintenance overhead when refactoring
- No type safety for patterns

## The Solution

**nestjs-microservice-auto-decorators** provides two powerful decorators that automatically generate and handle message patterns:

### `@AutoMessagePattern` - For Controllers

Automatically derives the message pattern from your controller's metadata:

```tsx
import { Controller } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AutoMessagePattern } from "nestjs-microservice-auto-decorators";

@Controller("users")
export class UsersController {
  @AutoMessagePattern()
  findAll() {
    // Automatically resolves to pattern "users.findAll"
    return this.usersService.findAll();
  }

  @AutoMessagePattern()
  findOne(id: string) {
    // Automatically resolves to pattern "users.findOne"
    return this.usersService.findOne(id);
  }
}
```

### `@AutoSend` - For Services

Automatically constructs message patterns and sends payloads via ClientProxy:

```tsx
import { Injectable, Inject } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ClientProxy } from "@nestjs/microservices";
import { AutoSend } from "nestjs-microservice-auto-decorators";

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  public serviceName = "users";

  constructor(
    @Inject("USERS_CLIENT") private readonly userClient: ClientProxy
  ) {}

  @AutoSend({ clientProperty: "userClient" })
  findAll() {
    // Sends {} to pattern "users.findAll"
  }

  @AutoSend({ clientProperty: "userClient" })
  findOne(id: string) {
    // Sends { id: '123' } to pattern "users.findOne"
  }
}
```

## Key Features

**🔄 Zero Configuration** - Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults

**📨 Smart Payload Handling** - Automatically wraps primitive values in objects

**🔍 Type Safety** - Fully typed with TypeScript for robust development

**🚀 Performance Optimized** - Minimal overhead with maximum convenience

**📊 Consistent Patterns** - Enforces naming conventions across your microservices
